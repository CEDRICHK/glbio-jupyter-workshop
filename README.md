# Preparing for the workshop

We only have two hours together, so there won't be any time during the workshop itself to install the software!
Participants are expected to have followed the instructions below to install the software and set up accounts
on the various services.  If you have problems with this before the workshop, [email the instructor](mailto:jonathan@dursi.ca)
for help.  We hope to be set up in the room an hour before hand for any last-minute issues.  Participants who
don't have the necessary software installed will have to find a partner who has and follow along with them.
